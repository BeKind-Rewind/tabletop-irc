## Description
AS A manager at an internet retail company, I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

Uses the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database.

Uses the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like a user’s MySQL username, password, and database name.

Syncs Sequelize models to a MySQL database on the server start.
